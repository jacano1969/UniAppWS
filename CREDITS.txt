eLab
eLab aims at promoting the development of eLearning applications 
at USI and SUPSI, as well as in the Italian speaking part of 
Switzerland. To achieve this goal, it provides the necessary 
infrastructures and services to USI and SUPSI faculties, 
departments, institutes, teachers, lecturers, and collaborators.
The laboratory also places its competences at disposal 
for collaborations with other institutions.

Moodbile - http://www.moodbile.org
This is a fork of the Moodbile project. Many thanks
to all people that have been working on it.

Where possibile UniAppWS has been kept compatible with 
Moodbile APIs. UniAppWS drops the support for Moodle 1.9.x so 
only Moodle 2.0 and latter versions are supported.
There are several differences between Moodbile and UniAppWS.
Part of this project has been developed from scratch.
